# Release Verification Record

## 2026-07-16 current local candidate

The repository was copied to `/tmp` without `.git` or caches and tested with
CPython 3.11.15, pytest 9.1.1, Ruff 0.15.21, and build 1.5.0.

- 89 tests passed.
- `ruff check .` passed.
- Wheel and sdist builds succeeded in isolated PEP 517 environments.
- The wheel installed without the source tree and successfully ran
  `temvera generate`, `temvera benchmark`, `temvera verify-dataset`, and
  aggregate `temvera verify-artifacts` against the accepted local runs.
- Wheel SHA-256:
  `6fd242e6b9966c9e86a88169be281de1d4a2bb6e45547702d879ac4e536dba54`
- Sdist SHA-256:
  `6461d678676cc4d862d9fa4e657eba4c984f3f495360e0c23ebe4a46cd605c1f`

The wheel contains `LICENSE`, declares Apache-2.0 in package metadata, and was
installed into a clean environment before the CLI smoke tests. The dataset and
artifact manifests also identify Apache-2.0 redistribution status.

The deterministic local research archive was also generated and passed its
internal verifier: 305 files and ten accepted runs, SHA-256
`f8fd2e150fd8a300a8bf4eef93c6997e41850530248bd874b34ed620f624c5d3`.
It is stored under ignored `dist/`, includes `LICENSE`, and records
`permitted_under_apache_2_0`. Public archive/DOI publication is deferred by
decision D-009.
The hashes describe candidates built immediately before this record was
updated; a public release must rebuild after final metadata and licensing.
